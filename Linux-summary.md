in response to those commands. Such a program is sometimes known as a command intrpreter. The term login shell is used to 
denote the process that is created to run a shell when the user first logs in. Whereas on some operating systems the command interpreter is an integral

(or, for that matter, a single user) on the same computer can simultaneously use different shells. A number of important shells have
appeared over time
